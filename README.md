# Adventure Works Container

This is a Dockerfile that builds a SQL Server container that has the Adventure Works database preinstalled. This makes it easier to get a quick test database with pre-populated data. There are also plenty of tutorials and examples created around this database which also makes it a great starting point.

## Warning 

It is preconfigured with a password for the SA account that is **ThisIsNotASecurePassword123**. This isn't mean to be used outisde of local testing or development so please don't consider using this as if it is a secure database.
